# Don't Sleep Glasses
# Introduction
This project consists in a pair of glasses that when the infrared reflectance sensor (TCRT5000) detects that your eyes are closed by seeing a difference in the reflection in the eyes (if your eyes are closed, theyâ€™re not reflecting anything) and for a long period of time (2 Minutes) it will sound an alarm by beeping you in the ear.

# Material List
# ESP32
ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series employs either a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations, Xtensa LX7 dual-core microprocessor or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor and includes built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, a Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by TSMC using their 40 nm process. It is a successor to the ESP8266 microcontroller.

# LEDs
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor.  White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device.

# TCRT5000
Infrared Reflective Sensor is used to detect the presence of an object within a specific range. The light emitted by the IR LED gets reflected by any object placed in front of the sensor and this reflection is detected by the photosensor(phototransistor).
Instead, a device using an RIR sensor emits its own short wavelength infrared beam and the RIR detects the infrared that is reflected back to it from any human or non-human object within its automatically programmable detection zone. It can continuously detect the presence of both a moving and stationary object.

# Buzzer
Buzzer is an electrical device that makes a buzzing noise and is used for signalling. When a voltage is applied across the two electrodes, the piezoelectric material mechanically deforms due to the applied voltage. This movement of the piezo disk within the buzzer creates sound in a similar manner as the movement of the ferromagnetic disk in a magnetic buzzer or the speaker cone mentioned above.
