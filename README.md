# Don't Sleep Glasses
# Introduction
This project consists in a pair of glasses that when the infrared reflectance sensor (TCRT5000) detects that your eyes are closed by seeing a difference in the reflection in the eyes (if your eyes are closed, theyâ€™re not reflecting anything) and for a long period of time (2 Minutes) it will sound an alarm by beeping you in the ear.
